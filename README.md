This schema organizes retail data, with Products, Customers, Stores and Calendar as primary entities.
Transactions Data and Return Data tables connect to these entities through foreign keys, establishing relationships for tracking product transactions and returns.

Products, Customers, Stores and Calendar tables have a one-to-many relationship with both Transactions Data and Return Data tables.

## Visualization:

The report comprises 4 pages:
1. Main
2. Customer
3. Product
4. Stores
